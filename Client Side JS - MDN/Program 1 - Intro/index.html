<!--

    - async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a 
    separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, 
    so the page loading is not blocked by the scripts.
    
    -  If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, 
    then use async.
    
    -  If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the 
    DOM being in place, load them using defer and put their corresponding <script> 
    elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
